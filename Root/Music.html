Page, Jones and Bonham are credited as the writers of the peice which really outlined the shape of the writing process of the band.

		<h3>Whole Lotta Love</h3>
		<h4>One of the earliest song where the lyrics are written by Plany himself, Whole Lotta Love became one of the groups best love tracks. Between the blues inspired inudendo the massive drum sound created by placing the kit in a large room with mics in unusual places, and the psycidelic mid section featuring experimental production from page.This song became the only single released in the UK in 1977 </h4>

	<h3>Since I've Been Loving You</h3>
	<h4>A seven and a half blues number was a live favourite for the band. Said to be the hardest track to record for the album, Since I've Been Loving You was a test for the entire band placing Jones on Hammond Organ and testing Plants vocal range. This song was originally meant for Led Zeppelin II but was bumped for "Whole Lotta Love". Legend tells that it only took Page a single take to master the guitar solo.</h4>

		<h3>Stairway to Heaven</h3>
		<h4>The most famous rock song of all time was first dreamt up by Page and Plant while hiking in the area surrounding Bron-Y-Ar. This was the only song with the lyrics printed on the inner sleeve, however it was prevented from becoming a chart hit by the bands unwillingness to release a shortened single version for radio. Once all of Zeppelins material became available for radio in finally charted in 2007</h4>
