<p>To begin my research for this project I aimed to find what practices are most effective for functionality and aesthetics. I studied some general websites and some more centred around my individual specification. 
Based of the standards outlined by w3s it was clear that in order to fully utilize the tools available in current versions of HTML I would have to use a range of tags to give a more specific structure, this included <nav>, <section>, <header> and <footer>. This aided with properly structuring the website while allowing 
In terms of visual aspects there are many standards I aimed to follow to create an attractive looking website.</p>
<ul> 
<li>Site header – it I common place for sites to use a top header with a logo and at the top of a page, and I felt it was necessary to replicate this as this is what users are used to seeing. This is important because a user will be able to tell where in the document they are and will also be able to easily navigate.</li>
<li>Consistency- Overall consistency of colour scheme and design should be apparent in a web page because it gives a stronger brand image and doesn’t look jarring to the user, simple colour schemes are often more effective.</li>
<li>Layout- Most sites will structure their sites from top left to bottom right for most important to least important because this is how most (western) users are accustomed to reading.</li>
<li>I aimed to follow these guidelines as much as could, to begin with I designed the logo area with an accompanying navigation bar to be placed beneath the logo. From here I could begin to plan what pages I would be including in the site. This will be consistent on every page. I also used a pre-existing logo to align with the brand image.</li>
<li>I kept my interactive media to a minimum so the site would remain simple and uncluttered. This also helps with reducing demand on older or less popular browsers so it doesn’t affect the user experience in any large way.</li>
<li>When writing my website I aimed to comment each section of code so it was clear to me what purpose it served.</li>
<li>I aimed to give an alternative for most of the images in my site so if an issue with the path occurs a description of the image will replace it. This is also necessary I feel because it allows those will hearing disabilities to have the images explained to them by a screen reader.</li>
<li>A further standard which needs to be followed during the creation of the website is the correct file structure convention. This was clearly laid out in lectures so I followed the given guide. Using a root folder to contain my html files then using more specific folders to hold CSS javascript and assets being used in the webpage. This was effective due to the small size of my site. This is also the case when naming files which will be used in the webpage such as images and videos need to be clearly labelled for ease of developing and editing the website.</li>
</ul>

HTML5 standards

</p>With each new updated version of HTML comes new practices and standards for dealing with the often more complex additions to the platform.</p>
<p>The first of these development that came to mind was the addition of imbedded audio and video files in HTML, this alone would make it a lot easier to implement these features into my web page with out having to configure complex plugins. It was especially important to be able to easily implement audio because of the nature of my site (band website). The one issue with this addition is that not all browsers support this yet.
HTML5 also allows for an embedded font to be used which will be shared across a range of browsers and devices when outputted. This makes my site more accessible and transferrable. While some changes do occur across browsers it is mostly compatible.
The website can be used on a range of browsers such as chrome or firefox. I also created a limited effect for allowing the web page to be used in a range of different formats such as mobile or when the screen size is reduced.</p>

<p>Challenges: I faced a range of challenges while creating this webpage with all aspect of the development. For the most part the HTML aspect was simple enough but it was often difficult to layout items on my page in a way that was clear and aesthetically pleasing. Because of the way I layered my div each part needed to be specifically planned out. The use of java script also lead to a range of problems including layouts being temporarily ruined when dragging and dropping.</p>
<p>Evaluation</p>
<ul>
<li>+ Makes web pages easier to build for the programmer as well making them easier to edit and rea for other people with a familiarity with HTML. By creating more specific tags and shortening overall code length.</li>
<li>+ Allow for a much sleeker and consistent design for webpages with more options and customisable features for a web page to more accurately fit a specification.</li>
<li>+ Less maintenance is needed for a webpage as many of the newer aspect are functioning across all browsers which means less time is needed adapting the code to fit a range of browser.</li>

<li>- Often the newer properties require a more developed knowledge of web development and the skills needed to configure many of these is beyond my range of experience meaning I had to learn a lot of new skills to implement them.</li>
<li>- Also despite a relatively universal acceptance of newer properties many do not function across all browsers which again will require knowledge of appropriating the page to the browsers which it doesn’t inherently accept. For example this website will not work on Internet Explorer.</li>
